Today on the teapod we discuss what and when the first animals were domesticated. Swine!?

We also go down the deep, meandering, unstructured rabbit hole of [notion.so](http://notion.so) - what is it? How do we use it? How do they use it? What is it? What's a table? How do you link things? What is it? What are some of it's competitors? WHAT IS IT?!

Visit [teapod.club](https://teapod.club/) and give us feedback on twitter [@418teapod](https://twitter.com/418teapod) or [discord](https://discord.gg/WJtHWWz)
